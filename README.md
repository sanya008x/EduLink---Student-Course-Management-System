# EduLink---Student-Course-Management-System
Project Title: "EduLink - Student & Course Management System"

Industry: Education Technology (EdTech)
Project Type: B2C Salesforce CRM implementation
Target Users: Admissions Team, Course Instructors, and Students

Problem Statement-
An online education platform is currently managing student applications, course enrollments, and communications through a fragmented and manual system involving spreadsheets and emails. This process is highly inefficient, prone to human error, and lacks a centralized view of student data and progress. As the platform grows, this manual approach is unsustainable and makes it difficult to provide a high-quality student experience, track enrollment trends, and scale operations effectively.

To address this, the company wants to implement a Salesforce CRM to:
#Automate the student application and enrollment process
#Centralize all student and course data
#Track student progress and course history
#Streamline communication with students, instructors, and the admissions team
#Enable real-time dashboards for management to track key metrics like enrollment and retention
